# imagedenoising

Within the field of image restoration, convolutional neu- ral networks (CNNs) have proved to perform well [1], [2]. In particular, architectures implementing skip-connections have performed well due to a focus on residual learning [1]. For that reason, this paper experimented with several different CNN architectures of increasing complexity with a focus on skip-connection architectures. Additionally, since the aim of this paper is to restore high quality images to facilitate the diagnosis process of human specialists, a big part of this pa- per was to identify a loss function addressing how the Human Visual System (HVS) is thought to work [3], [4].
